		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Text zooming in the Message View is now possible, using CTRL+mouse
  wheel up/down, CRTL+touchpad two-fingered vertical swiping, or
  the Message View's right-click menu.

* GtkColorChooser is now used in the Spell Checking preferences,
  Colour Label preferences, and the folder Properties pages.

* 'Default From:' has been added to the Compose page of the folder
  Properties. This allows setting an email address which will
  override the Account's email address.

* An option has been added to the 'General' page of the folder
  Properties, 'Skip folder when searching for unread or new
  messages', so that the folder can be skipped when using Go To
  next/previous unread/new message.

* 'By Sender' has been added to '/Tools/Create filtering rule/...'
  and '/Tools/Create processing rule/...'

* The option 'Run processing rules before marking all messages in a
  folder as read or unread' has been added to
  '/Configuration/Preferences/Display/Summaries'.

* It is now possible to add a toolbar button to 'Run folder
  processing rules'.

* The Actions configuration list now has 'Top' and 'Bottom' buttons.

* In '/Tools/List URLs' it is now possible to CTRL+c or right-click
  a list item and 'Copy URL'; copying multiple selections is also
  possible.
  Phishing URLs are now indicated in red by default. This uses the
  colour defined in the hidden preference, log_error_color.

* The method of handling Tags has been improved.

* When using the separate Message View the Enter key will open the
  currently selected message in the Message List. So, for example,
  if you delete the current message, pressing Enter will open the
  next message without having to leave the separate Message View.

* The quicksearch type-ahead keypress delay is now customizable
  using a hidden preference ("qs_press_timeout").

* Improvements to the storage of OAuth2 refresh tokens.

* A "View all" button has been added to the Themes preferences page
  in order to preview all icons of a theme.

* The term 'master passphrase' has been replaced in the UI with
  'primary passphrase'.

* The label 'SSL/TLS' has been replaced with 'TLS' in the UI.

* chmod 0600 is set on log files, history files, saved parts, etc.

* "Keyword Warner" plugin has been added. This shows a warning when
  sending or queueing a message and a reference to one or more
  user-defined keywords are found in the message text.

* Adding a new RSSyl feed or subscribing to a Webcal will
  automatically suggest using any suitable URI found on the
  clipboard.

* The user manuals have been updated.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, British English,
  Catalan, Czech, French, Indonesian, Polish, Romanian, Russian,
  Slovak, Spanish, Turkish.
