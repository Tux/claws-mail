		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Passwords can now be secured with a Master Passphrase.
  (/Configuration/Preferences/Other/Miscellaneous/)

* Passwords: The password storage method has changed. All passwords
  are now stored in a separate file, (~/.claws-mail/passwordstorerc),
  and use a stronger encryption than previously. Existing passwords
  are moved to the new file automatically, in the old format. The
  new format will be used whenever old passwords are changed or when
  a Master Passphrase is used. All new passwords are saved using the
  new format, irrespective of whether a Master Passphrase is used or
  not. Further information can be found here:
  http://www.claws-mail.org/doc/password_encryption.txt
