		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are upgrading from the GTK+ 2 version of Claws Mail, you will
need to reload any plugins that you want to use.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for the OAuth2 authorisation protocol has been added for
  IMAP, POP and SMTP using custom, user-generated client IDs.

  OAuth2 preferences are found in the Account Preferences on the
  Receive page (for POP: Authenticate before POP connection, for
  IMAP: Authentication method); the Send page (SMTP authentication:
  Authentication method); and on a dedicated OAuth2 page.

* The option 'Save (X-)Face in address book if possible' has been
  added to the /Message View/Text Options preferences page.
  Previously the (X-)Face would be saved automatically, therefore
  this option is turned on by default.

* The Image Viewer has been reworked. New options have been added to
  /Message View/Image Viewer: when resizing images, either fit the
  image width or fit the image height to the available space.
  Fitting the image height is the default. Regardless of this
  setting, when displaying images inline they will fit the height.

  When displaying an image, left-clicking the image will toggle
  between full size and reduced size; right-clicking will toggle
  between fitting the height and fitting the width.

* When re-editing a saved message, it is now possible to use
  /Options/Remove References.

* It is now possible to attempt to retrieve a missing GPG key via
  WKD.

* The man page has been updated.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, British English,
  Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Polish, Romanian, Russian,
  Slovak, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Turkish.

* bug fixes:
	o bug 2411, 'quicksearch_history content partially written to
		     stdout'
	o bug 4326, 'Xft.dpi != 96 messes with text display in
		     litehtml viewer'

	o bug 4447, '--enable-deprecated and --disable-deprecated
