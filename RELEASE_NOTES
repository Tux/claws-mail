  Backspace), has been improved.

* the Network Log now displays output from LDAP operations.

* "Go to last error" has been added to the Log Window context menu.

* Filtering/Processing: "mark_as_spam" is no longer a final action,
  since it does not move the marked message.

  Any/All header(s) (in Address Book) matcher rules.

  the user is now required to choose which Account to send it from.
