Unless --with-password-encryption=old is active, account passwords are
stored encrypted using AES-256-CBC, using following scheme:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption/decryption key is either PASSCRYPT_KEY, or user-selected master passphrase.

We take the digest of the key using SHA-512, which gives us a 64 bytes
long hash.

The first half of the hash is XORed with the second (1st byte with
33rd, 2nd with 34th, etc.). This is gives us 32 bytes, which is
the exact length required for AES-256-CBC.

IV for the cipher is filled with random bytes.


Encryption
----------
We prepare a buffer 128+blocksize bytes long, with one block of random
data at the beginning, followed by the password we want to encrypt,
rest is padded with zero bytes.

We encrypt the buffer.

We base64-encode the ciphertext, and store it as:
"{algorithm}encodedciphertext"


Decryption
----------
We strip the "{algorithm}" (after verifying that it matches what we
expect) and base64-decode the remaining ciphertext.

We decrypt the ciphertext.

We discard the first block, and the rest is a zero-terminated string
with our password.


Why the random block at the beginning?
--------------------------------------
We are taking advantage of property of CBC mode where decryption with
a wrong IV results in only first block being garbled. Therefore we
prepend a random block to our plaintext before encryption, and discard
first block from plaintext after decryption.


Master passphrase
-----------------
This can be any string user chooses. We store its 64 bytes long key
derivation (KD), using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1, and later check correctness
of user-entered passphrase by making same KD from it and comparing it
to the stored one. Only if the two KDs match, the passphrase is accepted
and remembered for session, thus giving access to account or plugin
passwords.

Salt used for PBKDF2 is stored in 'master_passphrase_salt', encoded
as base64. It consists of 64 randomly generated bytes.

Number of rounds for PBKDF2 is stored in hidden preference
'master_passphrase_pbkdf2_rounds'.
